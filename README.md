Goals with Map Page:
1. if user selects from navigation, go to default Map page without passing argument (accessed from router.js; result: blank map)
2. if user clicks on "See Map Here" from an individual species in the Reptiles page then pass the reptile species as an argument to the Map page (accessed from Reptiles.js; result: all the countries in that species' range will be highlighted)
3. if user clicks on a country from the list that includes all countries of a particular species's range (in Reptiles page), then a country is passed to the Map page (accessed from Reptiles.js; result: that country would be highlighted)
